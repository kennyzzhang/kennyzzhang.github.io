        On the Code Golf and Coding Challenges Stack Exchange, there was a long
        standing open problem to
        <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/11880/52152">
          Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life
        </a>
        .
        When I first saw this problem in high school, I completely disregarded
        it as something I could solve or contribute to.
        But it sat in the back of my head, nagging at me, and every now and then
        I'd check back in, and one day I noticed that there was actually a group
        of people working on a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plan was to abstract away from plain Conway's Game of Life using an
        existing pattern called the OTCA Metapixel, which allows individual
        metapixels to follow different simulation rules.
        Then, using the rule variations, simple wires and logic gates could be
        designed.
        Using the logic gates, more complex hardware necessary for a simple
        computer architecture could be built.
        Finally, tetris could be programmed in this computer's assembly
        language.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was the plan, anyways. When I joined, there were still some missing
        logic gates, the existing adder was large, delay circuitry was
        inefficient, and there was little progress on the more complex circuits.
        I got myself heavily involved in the hardware design, and spearheaded
        the construction of the final computer.

        Then also came the conversion from the rule variation simulator to
        actual metapixels.
        The original script we had was extraordinarily inefficient,
        TODO
