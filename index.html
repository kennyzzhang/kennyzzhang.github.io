      I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Stony Brook University who enjoys algorithmic research.
      I participate in the International Collegiate Programming Contest, and I have been Stony Brook's best algorithmic problem solver for the past two years.
      I have interned at IBM Research for two summers.
