          Hackers are &lsquo;control freaks&rsquo; in a way that has nothing to
          do with the usual coercive or authoritarian connotations of the term.
          In the same way that children delight in making model trains go
          forward and back by moving a switch, hackers love making complicated
          things like computers do nifty stuff for them.
          But it has to be their nifty stuff.
          They don't like tedium, nondeterminism, or most of the fussy, boring,
          ill-defined little tasks that go with maintaining a normal existence.
          Accordingly, they tend to be careful and orderly in their intellectual
          lives and chaotic elsewhere.
          Their code will be beautiful, even if their desks are buried in 3 feet
          of crap.

        There's so much nifty stuff to learn in Computer Science, and I enjoy
        learning about all of it.
        From your standard techniques like sorting, heaps, search trees, and
        hash tables, to more obscure ones like union-find, tries, suffix arrays,
        link-cut trees, and euler-tour trees, something about managing your data
        in a clever way and being able to prove that your data structure is
        asymptotically optimal is extraordinarilly satisfying to me.
      </p>

        Getting to see these algorithmic techniques in practice is why I like
        competitive programming, and evidently I have a bit of a knack for it.
        Freshman year, I got an email from a professor advertising Stony Brook
        Competitive Programming Club's selection contest, and despite being an
        anxious freshman, I decided to see what the club is about.
        &ldquo;Worst case I get free pizza and leave, no harm done,&rdquo;
        I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, after the selection contest was over, I got third place.
        The only people who scored better than me were graduate students.
        At this point, I'm roped into the club, attending weekly practices,
        preparing for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) in
        the Greater New York Region later in the year.
        We placed 12th, the best team from Stony Brook, and the second best
        freshman/sophomore team.
        Sophomore year, in the selection contest I placed first overall, and in
        the regional we placed 3rd overall.
        We advanced to the North Americal Division Championships, and while
        we found that there were lots of bigger fish in this ocean, we had a fun
        time continuing to think about the problems after the contest.
        Junior year, I repeated my first place performance in the selection
        contest, and in the regional we placed 7th overall.
        As of the time I am writing this, I am preparing for the next selection
        contest, and hope to keep my algorithmic problem solving skills sharp!
      </p>

        This interest in algorithms is why instead of taking my Computer Science
        degree and going straight for a well-paying job, I'm applying to PhD
        programs.
        Research seems like such a huge opportunity to continue to explore the
        field of Computer Science, and maybe push the boundaries of what we can
        make computers do.

          It is noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that
          the better a hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to
          have outside interests at which he or she is more than merely
          competent.

        I enjoy playing video games, though my game library is quite small.
        Once I get invested in a game, I will try to optimize my gameplay.
        Call me a tryhard all you want, but once you've played a game long
        enough, you need something extra to break the monotony.
        The first game I really put time into was Minecraft.
        Some redstone videos on YouTube had caught my interest, and the first
        thing I did when I got the game was fire up a creative world and toy
        around with making basic circuits.
        My favorite creation out of all my time playing the game is a fairly
        useless contraption that can send a block up and down a vertical shaft
        at 10 blocks per second. To get blocks to move that fast, I had to use
        (abuse?) a lot of technical mechanics hidden in the internals of
        Minecraft.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first idea is that the game processes the world in a loop, and that
        this loop is timed to run 20 times per second.
        Each pass through the loop is a tick, and you start off doing redstone
        by taking events that you want to happen in a certain order, and using
        delay circuitry to orchestrate the events.
        However, as you learn more about the game, about the order of events
        withing a single pass through the loop, you can start to manipulate
        events happening within a single tick.
        You learn about block updates, how instead of updating every block in
        the world on every game tick, changes made to the world are processed
        locally by having block state changes send notifiers to neighboring
        blocks, which may update their own state and recursively propagate more
        notifiers.
        You learn about how components like repeaters and redstone torces create
        delay by scheduling &lsquo;tile ticks,&rsquo; and you learn how to
        manipulate this queue of tile ticks to order events within a tick.
        You learn about how pistons operate on a different system of
        &lsquo;block events,&rsquo;, and how manipulating block events enables
        complex behaviors such as instant wire, 0-tick pulses, deleting any
        block &mdash; even if you're not supposed to be able to break it, and
        several duplication glitches.
        In terms of my block elevator, I heavily utilized 0-tick pulses to
        transport blocks instantly within a tick.
      </p>

        Technical Minecraft has advanced to the point at which people are diving
        into the game's code, tracing game execution to find ways to break the
        game.
        Watching a video on obtaining normally unobtainable items is the first
        time I learned about word tearing, a programming error that shows up in
        multithreading.
        While Minecraft is largely single-threaded, people were able to trick
        the game into keeping a second thread alive, and then were able to
        coordinate the threads with precise timings induced by hash map
        collisions to execute the word tearing bug in practice.
        I suppose this is another example of how &ldquo;making complicated
        things do nifty stuff&rdquo; is fascinating to me.
      </p>

        And I haven't even brought up how the player factors into all of this,
        how to optimize moving the player from point A to point B.
        You'd think that this would be basic, but there's a whole wiki called
        <a href="https://www.mcpk.wiki/wiki/Main_Page">
          MCPK
        </a>
        devoted to just this topic.
        There's also plenty of techniques for how to build bridges quickly, and
        multitudes of minigames on servers that start with teams separated by
        huge empty voids, and swiftly traversing these gaps is key to gaining an
        advantage over enemy teams.
        All this is to say that Minecraft is a game with a huge amount of depth,
        and while I arguably may have spent too much time playing this game, I
        have enjoyed every second of it.
