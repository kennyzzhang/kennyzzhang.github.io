          Hackers are &lsquo;control freaks&rsquo; in a way that has nothing to do
          with the usual coercive or authoritarian connotations of the term.
          In the same way that children delight in making model trains go forward
          and back by moving a switch, hackers love making complicated things like
          computers do nifty stuff for them.
          But it has to be their nifty stuff.
          They don't like tedium, nondeterminism, or most of the fussy, boring,
          ill-defined little tasks that go with maintaining a normal existence.
          Accordingly, they tend to be careful and orderly in their intellectual
          lives and chaotic elsewhere.
          Their code will be beautiful, even if their desks are buried in 3 feet
          of crap.

        There's so much nifty stuff to learn in Computer Science, and I enjoy
        learning about all of it.
        From your standard techniques like sorting, heaps, search trees, and
        hash tables, to more obscure ones like union-find, tries, suffix arrays,
        link-cut trees, and euler-tour trees, something about managing your data
        in a clever way and being able to prove that your data structure is
        asymptotically optimal is extraordinarilly satisfying to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting to see these algorithmic techniques in practice is why I like
        competitive programming, and evidently I have a bit of a knack for it.
        Freshman year, I got an email from a professor advertising Stony Brook
        Competitive Programming Club's selection contest, and despite being an
        anxious freshman, I decided to see what the club is about.
        &lquot;Worst case I get free pizza and leave, no harm done,&rquot;
        I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, after the selection contest was over, I got third place.
        The only people who scored better than me were graduate students.
        At this point, I'm roped into the club, attending weekly practices,
        preparing for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) in
        the Greater New York Region later in the year.
        We placed 12th, the best team from Stony Brook, and the second best
        freshman/sophomore team.
        Sophomore year, in the selection contest I placed first overall, and in
        the regional we placed 3rd overall.
        We advanced to the North Americal Division Championships, and while
        we found that there were lots of bigger fish in this ocean, we had a fun
        time continuing to think about the problems after the contest.
        Junior year, I repeated my first place performance in the selection
        contest, and in the regional we placed 7th overall.
        As of the time I am writing this, I am preparing for the next selection
        contest, and hope to keep my algorithmic problem solving skills sharp!
      </p>

        This interest in algorithms is why instead of taking my Computer Science
        degree and going straight for a well-paying job, I'm applying to PhD
        programs.
        Research seems like such a huge opportunity to continue to explore the
        field of Computer Science, and maybe push the boundaries of what we can
        make computers do.

          It is noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that the
          better a hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to have
          outside interests at which he or she is more than merely competent.
