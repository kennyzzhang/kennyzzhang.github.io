        I think the best way of starting this introduction is with a quote from
        the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/">Jargon File</a>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Hackers are &lsquo;control freaks&rsquo; in a way that has nothing to do
        with the usual coercive or authoritarian connotations of the term.
        In the same way that children delight in making model trains go forward
        and back by moving a switch, hackers love making complicated things like
        computers do nifty stuff for them.
        But it has to be their nifty stuff.
        They don't like tedium, nondeterminism, or most of the fussy, boring,
        ill-defined little tasks that go with maintaining a normal existence.
        Accordingly, they tend to be careful and orderly in their intellectual
        lives and chaotic elsewhere.
        Their code will be beautiful, even if their desks are buried in 3 feet
        of crap.

      <blockquote>
        It is noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that the
        better a hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to have
        outside interests at which he or she is more than merely competent.
